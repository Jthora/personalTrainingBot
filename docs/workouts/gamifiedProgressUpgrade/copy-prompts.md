# Copy & Prompts

## Coach Prompts (sample patterns)
- Session start: hype + focus + time estimate.
	- "Let’s roll. Cardio focus today, ~22 min. Stay smooth, finish strong."
	- "Upper power set incoming. About 18 min. Keep rests tight."
- Mid-session: encouragement tied to timer or item index.
	- "Halfway. Breathe steady, one rep at a time."
	- "Two intervals left—hold pace, then we recover."
- Completion: celebrate + streak/XP mention + suggest next.
	- "Done! +120 XP. Streak intact. Quick stretch, then hydrate."
	- "Session complete. Streak at 5—nice consistency. Want a finisher?"
- Off-goal/streak risk: gentle nudge.
	- "You’re close to keeping your streak. A 10-minute block will do it."
	- "Goals are 10 minutes away—quick preset can close the gap."
- Alignment warnings (difficulty):
	- "This block runs above your range. Swap to recommended?"
	- "Intensity mismatch. Adjust range or replace with a similar, safer block."
- Rate limits: max one mid-session prompt; respect quiet mode; suppress duplicate warnings.

## Recap Strings
- Core: XP gained, streak delta (+/-/freeze with reason), badges earned (list), goal/challenge progress, suggested next steps.
- Examples:
	- "Recap: +180 XP, streak +1 (now 6). Badges: Endurance 60. Goals: Daily 90% / Weekly 45%. Next: Quick 15 preset?"
	- "Recap: +0 XP (skips). Streak frozen—finish one item today to protect it. Weekly challenge: 2/3 sessions."
- Keep recap concise; one primary CTA; avoid stacking too many badges—truncate with +N.

## Share Text (clipboard)
- Light, anonymized summary; no personal data.
- Examples:
	- "Wrapped a 22-min cardio session. Earned 180 XP and unlocked Endurance 60."
	- "Finished today’s strength block. Streak day 5, challenge progress 2/3."
- Include a flag to disable share if not desired; keep under 200 chars.

## Tone & Style
- Supportive, concise, action-oriented; avoid shaming.
- Vary wording to prevent repetition; keep messages <140 chars when possible for prompts.
- Use present-tense encouragement; keep numbers clear (time, XP, streak).
- Honor quiet mode: no prompts/animations; keep essential state visible via chips.
