- Potential impact on existing functionality

### Pull Requests

#### Before Submitting
1. Check if similar PR already exists
2. Ensure your changes follow project conventions
3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Update documentation if needed

#### PR Process
1. Create a feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes following coding standards
3. Commit with clear messages:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new training module support"
```

4. Push to your fork:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

5. Create a pull request with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference to related issues
   - Screenshots if UI changes
   - Testing instructions

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

```typescript
/**
 * Loads training module data from cache or API
 * @param moduleId - The ID of the module to load
 * @returns Promise resolving to training module data
 */
async function loadTrainingModule(moduleId: string): Promise<TrainingModule> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper prop types
- Use CSS modules for styling
- Follow component naming conventions

```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
  title: string;
  onAction?: () => void;
}

const MyComponent: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ title, onAction }) => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      {onAction && <button onClick={onAction}>Action</button>}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### File Organization
- One component per file
- Use PascalCase for component files
- Use camelCase for utility files
- Group related files in directories

### Git Commit Messages
Use conventional commit format:
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Test additions or modifications
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add new workout category selection
fix: resolve timer synchronization issue
docs: update API documentation
style: improve component styling consistency
refactor: simplify data loading logic
test: add unit tests for card dealer
chore: update dependencies
```

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Writing Tests
- Write tests for new features
- Test both happy path and error cases
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies

```typescript
describe('CardDealer', () => {
  it('should shuffle deck randomly', () => {
    const deck = createMockDeck();
    const shuffled = CardDealer.shuffleDeck(deck);
    expect(shuffled).not.toEqual(deck);
  });

  it('should deal specified number of cards', () => {
    const deck = createMockDeck();
    const dealt = CardDealer.dealCards(deck, 5);
    expect(dealt).toHaveLength(5);
  });
});
```

## Documentation
